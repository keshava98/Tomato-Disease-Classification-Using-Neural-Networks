# Tomato-Disease-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks
• Developed a machine learning model to classify different diseases in Tomato leaf using a neural network model consisting of 3 layers \n
• Utilised 4500 training examples to train the model where each example was of size 256 pixel by 256 pixel RGB image of leaves \n
• Deployed techiniques of forward propagation and backpropagation and obtained an accuracy of 92.14% on test data set
